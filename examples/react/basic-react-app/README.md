# Basic React App with Didit

1. Run backend (check [backend folder](https://github.com/gamiumapp/didit-sdk-demos/tree/main/examples/react/basic-react-app/backend)). You will need to make some changes on the .env.local file (check [README](https://github.com/gamiumapp/didit-sdk-demos/blob/main/examples/react/basic-react-app/backend/README.md))
2. Run frontend (check [frontend folder](https://github.com/gamiumapp/didit-sdk-demos/tree/main/examples/react/basic-react-app/frontend)). You will need to make some changes on the DiditProvider component (check [README](https://github.com/gamiumapp/didit-sdk-demos/blob/main/examples/react/basic-react-app/frontend/README.md))
