# Basic React App with Didit - Frontend

1. Change `client_id` value of the [DiditProviderComponent](https://github.com/gamiumapp/didit-sdk-demos/blob/main/examples/react/basic-react-app/frontend/src/components/Didit/Provider.js) to the url of the backend server (run [backend server](https://github.com/gamiumapp/didit-sdk-demos/tree/main/examples/react/basic-react-app/backend) from parent folder). Note: Make sure that the url does not finish with a `/` since diditprovider adds the slash automatically. Example:  `client_id=http://localhost:3001`
2. `npm i` to install
2. `npm start` to run the app
